# Image-Forgery-Detection-through-Error-Level-Analysis-and-Convolutional-Neural-Networks

# Overview
Digital image forgery detection is a critical task in the field of image forensics, aiming to identify manipulated regions within images and preserve the integrity of visual content. This repository presents a comprehensive framework for detecting image forgeries by incorporating Error Level Analysis (ELA) in conjunction with prominent Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, including VGG-16, VGG-19, ResNet-50, Xception, and EfficientNetV3.
